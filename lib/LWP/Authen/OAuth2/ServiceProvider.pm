=head1 NAME

LWP::Authen::OAuth2::ServiceProvider - Understand OAuth2 Service Providers

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.02

=cut

our $VERSION = '0.02';

=head1 SYNOPSIS

This is a base module for representing an OAuth 2 service provider.  It is
implicitly constructed from the parameters to C<LWP::Authen::OAuth2-E<gt>new>,
and is automatically delegated to when needed.

The first way to try to specify the service provider is with the parameters
C<service_provider> and possibly C<client_type>:

    LWP::Authen::OAuth2->new(
        ...
        service_provider => "Foo",
        client_type => "bar", # optional
        ...
    );

The first parameter will cause L<LWP::Authen::OAuth2::ServiceProvider> to
look for either C<LWP::Authen::OAuth2::ServiceProvider::Foo>, or if that is
not found, for C<Foo>.  (If neither is present, an exception will be thrown.)
The second parameter will be passed to that module which can choose to
customize the service provider behavior based on the client_type.

The other way to specify the service provider is by passing in sufficient
parameters to create a custom one on the fly:

    LWP::Authen::OAuth2->new(
        ...
        authorization_endpoint => $authorization_endpoint,
        token_endpoint => $token_endpoint,

        # These are optional but let you get the typo checks of strict mode
        authorization_required_params => [...],
        authorization_optional_params => [...],
        ...
    );

See L<LWP::Authen::OAuth2::Overview> if you are uncertain how to figure out
the I<Authorization Endpoint> and I<Token Endpoint> from the service
provider's documentation.

=head1 KNOWN SERVICE PROVIDERS

The following service providers are provided in this distribution, with
hopefully useful configuration and documentation:

=over 4

=item L<LWP::Authen::OAuth2::ServiceProvider::Google|Google>

=back

=head1 SUBCLASSING

Support for new service providers can be added with subclasses.  To do that
it is useful to understand how things get delegated under the hood.

First L<LWP::Authen::OAuth2> asks L<LWP::Authen::OAuth2::ServiceProvider> to
construct a service provider.  Based on the C<service_provider> argument, it
figures out that it needs to load and use your base class.  A service
provider might need different behaviors for different client types.  You
are free to take the client type and dynamically decide which subclass of
yours will be loaded instead to get the correct flow.  Should your subclass
need to, it can decide that that a subclass of L<LWP::Authen::OAuth2> should
be used that actually knows about request types that are specific to your
service provider.  Hopefully most service providers do not need this, but
some do.

For all of the potential complexity that is supported, B<most> service
provider subclasses should be simple.  Just state what fields differ from the
specification for specific requests and client types, then include
documentation.  However even crazy service providers should be supportable.

Here are the methods that were designed to be useful to override.  See the
source if you have a need that none of these address.  But if you can do what
you need to do through these, please do.

=over 4

=item C<authorization_endpoint>

Takes no arguments, returns the URL for the Authorization Endpoint for the
service provider.  Your subclass cannot function without this.

=item C<token_endpoint>

Takes no arguments, returns the URL for the Token Endpoint for the service
provider.  Your subclass cannot function without this.

=item C<client_type_class>

This method receives your class name and the passed in C<client_type>.
It is supposed to make sure that the class that handles that
C<client_type> is loaded, and then return it.  This let's you handle service
providers with different behavior for different types of clients.

The base implementation just returns your class name.

If the programmer does not pass an explicit C<client_type> the value that is
passed in is C<default>.  So that should be mapped to a reasonable client
type.  This likely is something along the line of "webserver".  That way
your module can be used without specifying a C<client_type>.

=item C<init>

After C<new> has figured out the right class to load, it immediately calls
C<$self-e<gt>init($opts)> with C<$opts> being a hashref of all options passed
to C<LWP::Authen::OAuth2-E<gt>new(...)> that were not consumed in figuring
out the service provider.  This method can then extract any parameters that
it wants to before anything else happens.

If you only want to require/allow a few parameters to be extracted into the
service provider object, then there is no need to write your own C<init>.
But if you want additional logic depending on passed in parameters, you can.

To consume options and copy them to C<$self> please use the following
methods:

    $self->copy_option($opts, $required_field);
    $self->copy_option($opts, $optional_field, $default);

If you want to consume options and return them as values instead:

    my $value1 = $self->extract_option($opts, $required_field);
    my $value2 = $self->extract_option($opts, $optional_field, $default);

These methods delete from the hash, so do not try to consume an option twice.

=item C<required_init>

The parameters that must be passed into C<LWP::Authen::OAuth2-E<gt>new(...)>
to initialize the service provider object.  The default required parameters
are C<client_id> and C<client_secret>, which in turn get used as default
arguments inside of methods that need them.  In general it is good to only
require arguments that are needed to generate refreshed tokens.  If you will
not get a C<refresh_token> in your flow, then you should require nothing.

=item C<optional_init>

The parameters that can be passed into C<LWP::Authen::OAuth2-E<gt>new(...)> to
initialize the service provider object.  The default optional parameters are
C<redirect_uri> and C<scope> which, if passed, do not have to be passed into
other method calls.

The C<state> is not included as an explicit hint that you should not simply
use a default value.

Note that these lists are deduped, so there is no harm in parameters being
both required and optional, or appearing multiple times.

=item C<{authorization,request,refresh}_required_params>

These three methods list parameters that B<must> be included in the
authorization url, the post to request tokens, and the post to refresh
tokens respectively.  Supplying these can give better error messages if
they are left out.

=item C<{authorization,request,refresh}_optional_params>

These three methods list parameters that B<can> be included in the
authorization url, the post to request tokens, and the post to refresh
tokens respectively.  In strict mode, supplying any parameters not
included in more or required params will be an error.  Otherwise this has
little effect.

=item C<{authorization,request,refresh}_default_params>

These three methods returns a list of key/value pairs mapping parameters to
B<default> values in the authorization url, the post to request tokens, and
the post to get refreshed tokens respectively.  Supplying these can stop
people from having to supply the parameters themselves.

An example where this could be useful is to support a flow that uses
different types of requests than normal.  For example with some client types
and service providers, you might use a type of request with a
C<grant_type> of C<password> or C<client_credentials>.

=item C<post_to_token_endpoint>

When a post to a token endpoint is constructed, this actually sends the
request.  The specification allows service providers to require
authentication beyond what the specification requires, which may require
cookies, specific headers, etc.  This method allows you to address that case.

=item C<access_token_class>

Given a C<token_type>, what class implements access tokens of that type?  If
your provider creates a new token type, or implements an existing token type
in a quirky way that requires a nonstandard model to handle, this method can
let you add support for that.

The specification says that all the C<token_type> must be case insensitive,
so all types are lower cased for you.

If the return value does not look like a package name, it is assumed to be
an error message.  As long as you have spaces in your error messages and
normal looking class names, this should DWIM.

See L<LWP::Authen::OAuth2::AccessToken> for a description of the interface
that your access token class needs to meet.  (You do not have to subclass
that - just duck typing here.)

=item C<oauth2_class>

Override this to cause C<LWP::Authen::OAuth2-E<gt>new(...)> to return an object
in a custom class.  This would be appropriate if people using your service
provider need methods exposed that are not in L<LWP::Authen::OAuth2>.

Few service provider classes should find a reason to do this, but it can be
done if you need.

=item C<collect_action_params>

This is the method that processes parameters for a given action.  Should
your service provider support a new kind of request, you can use this along
with the C<*_{required,more,default}_params> functions to support it.

The implementation of C<request_tokens> in this module give an example of
how to use it.

=head1 CONTRIBUTING

Patches contributing new service provider subclasses to this distributions
are encouraged.  Should you wish to do so, please submit a git pull request
that does the following:

=over 4

=item Implement your provider

The more completely implemented, the better.

=item Name it properly

The name should be of the form:

    LWP::Authen::OAuth2::ServiceProvider::$ServiceProvider

=item List it

It needs to be listed as a known service provider in this module.

=item Test it

It is impossible to usefully test a service provider module without client
secrets.  However you can have public tests that it compiles, and private
tests that will, if someone supplies the necessary secrets, run fuller tests
that all works.  See the existing unit tests for examples.

=item Include it

Your files need to be included in the C<MANIFEST> in the root directory.

=item Document Client Registration

A developer should be able to read your module and know how to register
themselves as a client of the service provider.

=item List Client Types

Please list the client types that the service provider uses, with just
enough detail that a developer can figure out which one to use.  Listed
types should, of course, either be implemented or be documented as not
implemented.

=item Document important quirks

If the service provider requires or allows useful parameters, try to mention
them in your documentation.

=item Document limitations

If there are known limitations in your implementation, please state them.

=item Link to official documentation

If the service provider provides official OAuth 2 documentation, please link
to it.  Ideally a developer will not need to refer to it, but should know how
to find it.

connect to Google with OAuth2.
